If you are interested in reading it before it is officially released, please follow the following:

1. Download the code using whatever way you want (download zip, clone, github desktop, etc).
2. Open the folder (if you downloaded zip, you may need to extract the whole directory) and double-click `main.tex`
3. Compile it via `pdfLaTeX` using whatever LaTeX editor you use. For the record, I'm using the latest version of TeXstudio.
