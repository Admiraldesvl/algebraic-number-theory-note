My note on algebraic number theory. More details come up when the book is enriched. For LaTeX template please refer to [`elegantbook`](https://elegantlatex.org/en/).

If you are interested in reading it before it is officially released, please follow the following:

1. Download the code using whatever way you want (download zip, clone, github desktop, etc).
2. Open the folder (if you downloaded zip, you may need to extract the whole directory) and double-click `main.tex`
3. Compile it via `pdfLaTeX` using whatever LaTeX editor you use. For the record, I'm using the latest version of TeXstudio.

If you are considering contributing to this project, distribute it, or whatever not about simply reading it, please consider the following:

1. Read the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Admiraldesvl/algebraic-number-theory-note/blob/master/LICENSE)
2. Learn how to do [first contribution on github](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) if you are not familar with this yet.
3. UK spelling. For example, in this project you will see `localisation` in lieu of `localization`, `programme` in lieu of `program`.
