My note on algebraic number theory. More details come up when the book is enriched. For LaTeX template please refer to [`elegantbook`](https://elegantlatex.org/en/).

Thank everyone for coming. I hope this note can help you and I sincerely thank whoever helps me on this project.

Books that are mainly used for this note:

1. JÃ¼rgen Neukirch, *Algebraic Number Theory*.
2. Serge Lang, *Algebraic Number Theory*.
3. Daniel A. Marcus, *Number Fields*.

The author of this project claims no contribution on the advancement to mathematics research.

If you are interested in reading it before it is officially released, please follow the following:

1. Download the code using whatever way you want (download zip, clone, github desktop, etc).
2. Open the folder (if you have downloaded zip, you may need to extract all files) and open `main.tex` using whatever LaTeX editor you use. For the record, I'm using the latest version of TeXstudio.
3. Compile it via `pdfLaTeX`. This is given by the book template so other compiling commands are not recommended.
4. You cannot get pdf file in other ways because uploading binary files in a repository is not a good idea.

If you are considering contributing to this project, distributing it, or whatever not about simply reading it, please consider the following:

1. Read the [LICENSE](https://github.com/Admiraldesvl/algebraic-number-theory-note/blob/master/LICENSE)
2. Learn how to do [first contribution on github](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) if you are not familar with this yet. If you don't want to work on this anyway, you can also open an issure to speak about your problem. If points are valid, you shall also be considered as contributors.
3. UK spelling. For example, in this project you will see `localisation` in lieu of `localization`, `programme` in lieu of `program`. There is no special reason. Both UK and US spellings are not bad, but a mixture of them is.
4. Make sure you use macros defined in `main.tex`.

If you want to contribute to this project but have no idea where to start, please consider the folloing:

1. Typo correction.
2. Formatting correction.
3. Small mathematical problems (for example, miscalculation shall be corrected). 
4. Whenever you find something mathematically wrong, please do not hesitate to give a feedback.
5. Add examples at appropriate positions (but chances are I will modify them. Please try to follow the style of the book as well).
6. Check if the writing follows several guidelines for mathematics writing. If not, find out how to fix it for good reasons.

Writing Guidelines:

1. [Tips for Authors - J.S. Milne](https://www.jmilne.org/math/tips.html)
2. [Ten Simple Rules for Mathematics Writing](https://www.mit.edu/~dimitrib/Ten_Rules.pdf)
